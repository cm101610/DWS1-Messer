		<h2>The History of the Yankees</h2>
		
			<p>The <strong>history of the New York Yankees</strong> Major League Baseball (MLB) team began with the founding of the American League (AL) in 1901. The Baltimore Orioles were one of the league's original eight clubs; after two years, the organization was replaced by a New York City-based franchise, which became known as the Yankees in 1913. The team infrequently contended for the AL championship before the acquisition of outfielder Babe Ruth after the 1919 season. Shortly afterwards, the Yankees won their inaugural AL title in 1921, followed by their first World Series championship in 1923. Ruth and first baseman Lou Gehrig were part of New York's Murderers' Row batting lineup, which led the Yankees to a then-AL record 110 wins and a Series championship in 1927. They repeated as World Series winners in 1928, and their next title came under manager Joe McCarthy in 1932.</p>
			
			<p>From 1936 to 1939, the Yankees won the World Series every year, with a team that featured Gehrig and outfielder Joe DiMaggio, who recorded a record hitting streak during New York's 1941 championship season. The Yankees set a major league record by winning five consecutive championships from 1949 to 1953, and appeared in the World Series nine times during the next 11 years. Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Whitey Ford were among the players fielded by the Yankees during the era. After the 1964 season, a lack of effective replacements for aging players caused the franchise to decline on the field, while then-owners CBS posted financial losses.</p>
			
			<p>George Steinbrenner bought the club in 1973 and regularly invested in new talent, using free agency to acquire top players. Despite internal disputes in the late 1970s, the team reached the World Series four times between 1976 and 1981 and claimed the championship in 1977 and 1978. New York continued to pursue its strategy of signing free agents into the 1980s, but with less success, and the team's performance declined by the late-1980s. The club's leadership eventually began to rebuild around young players from the team's minor league system, including Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. After earning a playoff berth in 1995, the Yankees won four of the next five World Series, and the 1998-2000 teams were the last in MLB to win three straight Series titles.</p>
			
			<p>As the 2000s progressed, the Yankees' rivalry with the Boston Red Sox increased in intensity as the sides met multiple times in the American League Championship Series, trading victories in 2003 and 2004. New York regularly reached the postseason, but were often defeated in the first two rounds. In 2009, the Yankees opened Yankee Stadium after spending most of the previous 86 seasons playing in a ballpark of the same name. That year's squad won the World Series for the 27th time in team history. The furthest the Yankees have gone in the postseason since then is the ALCS, which the 2010 and 2012 teams played in.</p>
