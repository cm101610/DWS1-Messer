			<h2><a id="History"></a>The History of the Yankees</h2>

			<p>The <strong>History of the New York Yankees</strong><abbr title="Major League Baseball"> MLB</abbr> 
			team began with the founding of the <abbr title="American League">AL</abbr> in 1901. The Baltimore Orioles 
			were one of the league's original eight clubs; after two years, the organization was replaced by a New York 
			City-based franchise, which became known as the Yankees in 1913. The team infrequently contended for the 
			<abbr title="American League">AL</abbr> championship before the acquisition of outfielder Babe Ruth after the 
			1919 season. Shortly afterwards, the Yankees won their inaugural <abbr title="American League">AL</abbr> title 
			in 1921, followed by their first World Series championship in 1923. Ruth and first baseman Lou Gehrig were part 
			of New York's Murderers' Row batting lineup, which led the Yankees to a then-<abbr title="American League">AL</abbr> 
			record 110 wins and a Series championship in 1927. They repeated as World Series winners in 1928, and their next 
			title came under manager Joe McCarthy in 1932.</p>

			<p>From 1936 to 1939, the Yankees won the World Series every year, with a team that featured Gehrig and outfielder 
			Joe DiMaggio, who recorded a record hitting streak during New York's 1941 championship season. The Yankees set a 
			major league record by winning five consecutive championships from 1949 to 1953, and appeared in the World Series 
			nine times during the next 11 years. Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Whitey Ford were among the players fielded by 
			the Yankees during the era. After the 1964 season, a lack of effective replacements for aging players caused the 
			franchise to decline on the field, while then-owners CBS posted financial losses.</p>

			<p>George Steinbrenner bought the club in 1973 and regularly invested in new talent, using free agency to acquire top 
			players. Despite internal disputes in the late 1970s, the team reached the World Series four times between 1976 and
			1981 and claimed the championship in 1977 and 1978. New York continued to pursue its strategy of signing free agents 
			into the 1980s, but with less success, and the team's performance declined by the late-1980s. The club's leadership 
			eventually began to rebuild around young players from the team's minor league system, including Derek Jeter and 
			Mariano Rivera. After earning a playoff berth in 1995, the Yankees won four of the next five World Series, and the 
			1998-2000 teams were the last in MLB to win three straight Series titles.</p>

			<p>As the 2000s progressed, the Yankees' rivalry with the Boston Red Sox increased in intensity as the sides met
			multiple times in the American League Championship Series, trading victories in 2003 and 2004. New York regularly
			reached the postseason, but were often defeated in the first two rounds. In 2009, the Yankees opened Yankee Stadium 
			after spending most of the previous 86 seasons playing in a ballpark of the same name. That year's squad won the World
    		Series for the 27th time in team history. The furthest the Yankees have gone in the postseason since then is the 
    		<abbr title="American League Championship Series">ALCS</abbr>, which the 2010 and 2012 teams played in.</p>

		<h2><a id="Three"></a>My Top Three Yankees</h2>
		
		<article>
			<h3><a id="DiMaggio"></a>Joltin' Joe DiMaggio (1936-1951)</h3>

			<p><img src="images/dimaggio_small1.png" alt="DiMaggio1" class="align-left" />With Ruth retired, Gehrig finally had 
			a chance to take center stage, but it was only one year before a new star appeared: Joe DiMaggio. The team would win an 
			unprecedented four straight World Series titles from 1936 to 1939. For most of 1939, however, they had to do it without 
			Gehrig, who was forced to retire because of <em><strong>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</strong></em>, now nicknamed 
			<q><em><strong>Lou Gehrig's Disease</strong></em></q> in his honor. The Yankees declared July 4, 1939 to be <q>Lou Gehrig Day</q>, 
			on which they retired his number 4 (the first retired number in baseball). Gehrig made a famous speech in which he declared 
			himself to be <q>the luckiest man on the face of the earth.</q> He died two years later.</p>

			<p>Often described as the last year of the <q>Golden Era</q> before World War II and other realities intervened, 1941 
			was a thrilling year as America watched two major events unfold: Ted Williams of the Red Sox hunting for the elusive 
			.400 batting average and Joe DiMaggio getting hits in consecutive ballgames.</p>
	
			<blockquote><strong><em>By the end of his hitting streak, DiMaggio hit in 56 consecutive games, the current major 
			league record and one often deemed unbreakable.</em></strong></blockquote>

			<p>Two months and one day after the Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1941 World Series, the Japanese attacked 
			Pearl Harbor, and many of their best players, including DiMaggio himself, went off to serve in the military. The 
			Yankees still managed to pull out a win against the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1943 World Series.</p>

			<p><img src="images/dimaggio_small2.jpg" alt="DiMaggio2" class="align-right" />In 1945 construction magnate Del Webb and partners Dan Topping and Larry MacPhail purchased the team from the 
			Ruppert estate for $2.8 million; MacPhail was bought out in 1947.</p>

			<p>After a few slumping seasons, McCarthy was fired early in 1946. A few interim managers later, Bucky Harris took the
			job, righting the ship and taking the Yankees to a hard fought series victory against the Dodgers.</p>

			<p><img src="images/dimaggio_small3.jpg" alt="DiMaggio3" class="align-left" />Despite finishing only three games behind the first place Cleveland Indians in 1948, Harris was released in favor of
			Casey Stengel, who had a reputation of being a clown and managing bad teams. His tenure as Yankee field manager, however, 
			was marked with success. The <q>underdog</q> Yankees came from behind to catch and surprise a powerful Red Sox team on the 
			last two days of the 1949 season, a face off that fueled the beginning of the modern Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. By this time, 
			however, DiMaggio's career was winding down, and the <q>Yankee Clipper</q> retired after the 1951 season. This year marked 
			the arrival of the <q>Oklahoma Kid</q>, Mickey Mantle, who was one of several new stars that would fill the gap.</p>

			<br><br><h3><a id="Mattingly"></a>Don Mattingly (1982-1995)</h3>

			<p><img src="images/mattingly_small1.jpg" alt="Mattingly1" class="align-right" /><strong>Donald Arthur <q>Don</q> Mattingly</strong> (born April 20, 1961) is an American professional baseball first baseman, 
			coach and manager. Mattingly is currently the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball. Nicknamed 
			<q><strong>The Hit Man</strong></q>, <q><strong>Don Battingly</strong></q>, and <q><strong>Donnie Baseball</strong></q>, he spent his entire 
			14-year career playing for the New York Yankees.</p>

			<p><img src="images/mattingly_small2.JPG" alt="Mattingly2" class="align-left" />Mattingly graduated from Reitz Memorial High School in Evansville, Indiana, and was selected by the Yankees in the amateur 
			draft. Debuting with the Yankees in 1982 after three seasons in minor league baseball, Mattingly emerged as the Yankees' starting 
			first baseman after a successful rookie season in 1983. Mattingly was named to the American League (AL) All-Star team six times. 
			He won nine Gold Glove Awards, three Silver Slugger Awards, the 1984 AL batting title, and was the 1985 AL Most Valuable Player.</p>
			
			<blockquote><strong><em>Mattingly served as captain of the Yankees from 1991 through 1995, when he retired as a player.
			</em></strong></blockquote> 
	
			<p>The Yankees retired Mattingly's uniform number, 23, after his retirement. He has also received consideration for induction to the 
			National Baseball Hall of Fame, though he has not been elected.</p>

			<p>Returning to the Yankees as a coach in 2004 for manager Joe Torre, he followed Torre to the Dodgers in 2008, and succeeded him as 
			the Dodgers' manager in 2011.</p>

			<br><h3><a id="Jeter"></a>Derek Jeter (1995-2014)</h3>

			<p><img src="images/jeter_small1.jpg" alt="Jeter1" class="align-left" /><strong>Derek Sanderson Jeter</strong> (born June 26, 1974) is an American former baseball shortstop who played 20 seasons in 
			Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees. A five-time World Series champion, Jeter is regarded as a central figure of the 
			Yankees' success of the late 1990s and early 2000s for his hitting, baserunning, fielding, and leadership. He is the Yankees' all-time 
			career leader in hits (3,465), doubles (544), games played (2,747), stolen bases (358), times on base (4,716), plate appearances
			(12,602) and at bats (11,195). His accolades include 14 All-Star selections, five Gold Glove Awards, five Silver Slugger Awards, 
			two Hank Aaron Awards, and a Roberto Clemente Award. Jeter became the 28th player to reach 3,000 hits and finished his career sixth 
			all-time in career hits and the all-time MLB leader in hits by a shortstop.</p>

			<p><img src="images/jeter_small3.jpg" alt="Jeter3" class="align-right" />The Yankees drafted Jeter out of high school in 1992, and he debuted in the major leagues in 1995. The following year, he became 
			the Yankees' starting shortstop, won the Rookie of the Year Award, and helped the team win the 1996 World Series. Jeter continued 
			to contribute during the team's championship seasons of 1998-2000; he finished third in voting for the American League (AL) Most 
			Valuable Player (MVP) Award in 1998, recorded multiple career-high numbers in 1999, and won both the All-Star Game MVP and World Series
			MVP Awards in 2000. He consistently placed among the AL leaders in hits and runs scored for most of his career, and served as the Yankees' 
			team captain from 2003 until his retirement in 2014. Throughout his career, Jeter contributed reliably to the Yankees' franchise successes. 
			He holds many postseason records, and has a .321 batting average in the World Series.</p>
		
			<blockquote><strong><em>Jeter has earned the nicknames of <q>Captain Clutch</q> and <q>Mr. November</q> due to his outstanding play 
			in the postseason.</em></strong></blockquote>

			<p>Jeter has been one of the most heavily marketed athletes of his generation and is involved in several product endorsements. His personal 
			life and relationships with celebrities have drawn the attention of the media throughout his career. Teammates and opponents alike regard 
			Jeter as a consummate professional and one of the best players of his generation.</p>

		<h2><a id="Championships"></a>World Series Championships</h2>
	
		<p>The Yankees have won a leading 27 World Series in 40 appearances (which, since the first World Series in 1903, currently amounts to an 
		average appearance every 2.7 seasons and a championship every 4.0 seasons); the St. Louis Cardinals are second with 11 World Series victories. 
		The Yankees' number of World Series losses, 13, leads in Major League Baseball. The St. Louis Cardinals, Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers and 
		New York/San Francisco Giants are second in total World Series appearances with eighteen apiece.</p>
	
		<p>Of their eighteen World Series appearances, 
		the Dodgers have faced the Yankees eleven times, going 3–8 against the Yankees, while the Giants have faced the Yankees seven times, going 2–5 
		against the Yankees.[61] Among North American major sports, the Yankees' success is only approached by the 24 Stanley Cup championships of the 
		Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League, though the Canadiens haven't won a Cup championship since 1993. The Yankees have played in the 
		World Series against every National League pennant winner except the Houston Astros and the Colorado Rockies, a feat that no other team is even close 
		to matching.</p>
	
		<p>Through 2013, the Yankees have an all-time regular season winning percentage of .568 (a 9947–7570 record), the best of any team in baseball.</p>
	
		<p>The Yankees have won <strong>27 World Series Championships</strong>. Their most recent one came in 2009, under manager Joe Girardi, 
		when they defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.</p>
